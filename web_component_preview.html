            Professor Ip is the Chairperson of the Department of Microbiology at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
            She is an expert in Clinical Microbiology and Infection and is a renowned member of various
            Antibiotics-related committees.</p>
          <p>
            During an interview with Prof. Margaret Ip, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the current situation
            of antibiotic resistance in Hong Kong and the corresponding detection methods. We discussed the various
            genome analysis methods being used in hospitals and the challenges faced by frontline doctors. DNA
            sequencing with protein analysis is the most common way to detect antibiotic resistance genes, but it is
            expensive, especially in developing countries. It requires a lab expert and a large machine to analyze. We
            also discussed the sensitivity and stability of the detecting targets, and Prof. Ip suggested that DNA is
            more stable and sensitive than detecting protein or toxin produced by bacteria only. We received positive
            feedback from Prof. Ip regarding our project to detect antibiotic-resistant genes with a point-of-care
            device. She suggested that we detect multiple genes in one test for the sake of sensitivity and accuracy due
            to the occurrence of multiple genes in bacteria. Moreover, she emphasized that our point-of-care device
            should be cheaper and faster than DNA sequencing techniques currently used.
          </p>
          <p>
          We plan to detect desired DNA for checking antibiotic-resistant bacteria (targeted bacteria). Protein and
          toxin will be our alternative if the DNA sensing approach does not work in our web lab.
